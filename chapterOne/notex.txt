React is used to create single page application for example react website and if you look at NASA Website thats not a single page application. wahan ek page se dusre page jane ke liye apka page dubara reload hota hai so singe page application mein nahi hota hai. Single page application mein page dubara realod nahi hota hai sirf content dynamically update hota hai using Javascript and Virtual Dom.
